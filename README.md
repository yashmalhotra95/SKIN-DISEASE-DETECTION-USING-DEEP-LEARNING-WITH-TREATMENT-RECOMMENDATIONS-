# SKIN-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-WITH-TREATMENT-RECOMMENDATIONS-

## Skin Disease Detection and Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based system that detects and classifies multiple skin diseases from medical images and provides tailored treatment recommendations. Designed as an academic project, it combines CNN-based image classification with a user-friendly GUI for real-time diagnosis.

---

## Project Overview

- Utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **ResNet50** backbone trained on a dataset of 19 skin diseases.
- Achieved **90% classification accuracy** using transfer learning and image augmentation techniques.
- Offers **real-time predictions** through a **Tkinter-based GUI** which accepts both uploaded images and webcam input.
- Automatically provides **medical recommendations** (medications and precautions) based on the classified condition.

##  Key Features

- **19-class classifier** for diseases such as Acne, Melanoma, Eczema, Fungal Infections, and more.
- Integrated **treatment mapping system** with disease-specific prescriptions and care guidelines.
- **Grad-CAM** integration for model interpretability.
- GUI app built with **Tkinter** for accessibility and offline use.
